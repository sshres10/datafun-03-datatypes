"""
Purpose: Illustrate tuples, sets, and dictionaries in Python.

Tuples, sets, and dictionaries are all iterable objects. 
That means that they can be used in a for loop.
And with filter() and map() functions (better!)
And with comprehension syntax (the best!)

Here are some examples for tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

    TUPLES .......................................................

    In Python, a tuple is a immutable sequence type. 
    This means that once you create a tuple, 
    you cannot change the values it contains: 
    you can't add, remove, or change the values of any of the elements 
        in the tuple.
    Tuples are created using parentheses.

    You can access the elements of a tuple using indexing, like a list.
    The first index is 0 and the last index is -1.

    Since a tuple (like a list) is ordered, you can use slicing to get a
    range of elements from the tuple. [start:end:step]

    Tuples support concatenation, repetition, and membership testing.

    Tuples enable a function to return multiple values, for example:
    (slope, intercept) = statistics.linear_regression(xlist, ylist)
    (host, port) = get_host_and_port()

    Tuples are often used as keys in dictionaries.

    SETS .......................................................    

    A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.
    A set is created using curly braces.
    Sets can use the same methods as lists and tuples.
    Sets support the following operations:

    Membership testing (using the in and not in operators)
    Element addition (using the add method)
    Element removal (using the remove and discard methods)
    Set union (using the union method or the | operator)
    Set intersection (using the intersection method or the & operator)
    Set difference (using the difference method or the - operator)
    Set symmetric difference (using the symmetric_difference method or ^ operator)

    """
    DICTIONARIES .......................................................    

    A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
    A dictionary is created using curly braces.
    A dictionary is accessed using keys, not indexes.
    A dictionary is mutable, so you can add, remove, and change values.
    A dictionary is iterable, so you can use it in a for loop.
    A dictionary is not ordered, so you can't slice to access a range of values.

    Dictionaries support the following operations:

    Indexing: access the value associated with a key in the dictionary. 
    For example: dogA['name'].

    Membership testing: use 'in' and 'not in' operators 
    to test whether a key is in the dictionary. 
    For example: 'name' in dogA.

    Adding and updating items: use indexing to add a new key-value pair,
    or to update the value associated with an existing key. 
    For example: dogA['age'] = 2.

    Removing items: Use the del statement to remove a key-value pair. 
    For example: del dogA['weight_kg'].

    Iteration: You can use a for loop to iterate over the 
    keys, values, or key-value pairs in a dictionary. 
    For example: for key in dogA: print(key)

    Dictionaries are a lot like 
    JSON objects - a common data format used in web development.
